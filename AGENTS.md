## Working agreements

- Always run `npm test` after modifying JavaScript files.
- Prefer `pnpm` when installing dependencies.
- Ask for confirmation before adding new production dependencies.
- Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
